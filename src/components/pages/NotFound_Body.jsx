                            As a web master, instructor, and graphic designer based in Kathmandu, Nepal, I specialize in web development and design media. I take complex problems and transform them into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs. However, despite my expertise in creating web pages, I regret to inform you that <b style={{color:"#FFC562"}}>the specific page youâ€™re searching for does not exist on my website</b>. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
                            </p>
                            <p>
If you want to see the page you are trying to search for in the future, then please let me know. I will appreciate your call on that and give you credit for making that page possible to publish on my website.
